# estadistica-bayesiana

A repository for a university project of the subject Bayesian Statistics

# Description

This project was created to fulfill the objectives and assignments set throughout the semester by professors Ignacio Evangelista and Tomás Capretto in the Bayesian Statistics course, part of the Bachelor's Degree in Statistics (National University of Rosario).

The repository was created to streamline group work, so we apologize in advance for any lack of organization.
